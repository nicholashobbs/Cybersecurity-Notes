# Conda

Conda allows you to create environments, where dependencies, files, and packages are kept separately. To create a new environment use `conda create --name environame packages-to-use`. To activate an environment, use `source activate environame` and to list available environments use `conda info --envs`

use the command `anaconda-navigator` to open the navigator (I can't get it to stick on the side for some reason) - or use `jupyter notebook --allow-root` to get into a jupyter notebook. (if you weren't root this isn't necessary.)
