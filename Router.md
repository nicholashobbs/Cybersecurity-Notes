Install ipt-netflow - but first we have to install yaourt (or build packages manually..)

Ping isn't working after shorewall start. It works again after shorewall clear, but messages are still coming up. I tried shorewall show log and apparently I haven't set up the logs either. I guess this is to be expected when I threw on the sample config and expected that to work. I will go back and read through my notes again and see if i can change some configurations to get it working.
