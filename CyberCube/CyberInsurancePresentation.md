## Cyber Insurance Presentation


### Introduction (for those who don’t know)

I am presenting at the CAI Community Association Law Seminar on Cyber Risk Reduction for Lawyers (Cyber Risk Reduction and Insurance for Lawyers and their Clients)

We are going to talk about what attorneys should be doing to keep themselves and their clients protected from cyber threats.

My Co-presenters are my Dad who has been involved with that organization for a while and Andrew Terrell who is a lawyer from a large firm in Washington DC.

The Community Insurance and Risk Management Specialist Master Program is being conducted at the same time, so there are also a number of Insurance professionals and Risk Managers for homeowners associations there.

We are going to talk about the differences in what small firms should be doing to protect themselves, compared with what a larger firm with a big network would have to do.

### Introduction (Presentation)

First, I will cover some simple practical steps that everyone can take to improve their security posture for those who are unlikely to put much effort into being secure.

Next, I will discuss how the regulatory environment is changing this is likely to eventually make everyone have to pay more attention to cybersecurity. I will quickly review what the consequences of GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2020 are and who the regulations apply to.

Cyber insurance is relatively new, but a good option for those who want to cover themselves in case of loss. We are going to cover some terminology about coverages and exclusions and talk about where and how to get cyber insurance.

Finally, we will talk briefly about what a larger business might want to do about security and I will talk about some resources for those who want to do more research on their own.

First Steps to Being More Secure
For many small businesses cybersecurity is an afterthought, because the consequences of not thinking about security are usually not immediately recognizable.

The first question to consider when thinking about your cyber-defense posture is what information or assets you have which might be valuable to someone.

Most cyber attacks which impact average individuals and small businesses are high volume and low effort attacks - phishing, taking over unsecured devices, targeting outdated software, or pretexting.

Cyber criminals will not let you know when they’ve stolen your data, and therefore you will likely not find out for months, if ever, that they have. According to the 2018 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 68% of breaches took months or longer to discover.

The most common cyber attacks all involve social engineering. According to the 2018 DBIR, 30% of breaches came from malware and 17% of attacks were purely social. Criminals target people because they are often the easiest way to get the resources they need.

Pretexting is impersonating someone for social engineering purposes, by taking over their email or assuming their identity by other means. Pretexting attacks triples between 2017 and 2018 according to the DBIR as criminals look to make bigger profits from fewer targets.

Improperly patched software was the third most common cause of attacks, accounting for 17% of data breaches in 2018. This is probably the simplest of all security issues to remediate, and can be avoided by taking the time to update everything often.

Another recent trend in cyber attacks is ransomware, for example the WanaCry virus which encrypted computers’ hard drives and demanded a payment in bitcoin to restore the information. Ransom payments usually do not restore the data, and the only way to prevent this type of problem is to keep regular backups.

#### Hardware
* What devices do your employees use to access your company’s data? Computers, phones, tablets, servers, printers, IOT devices, industrial equipment controlled by computers?
* What data is on your devices?
* What data do you have on paper?
* Is your data backed up? Where?
#### Software
* What policies and procedures do you follow for updating software?
* What policies or control do you have over what software is installed on devices which are used with company data?
* How do you manage access to programs and data?
* What software and data do you have which is internet-based? What policies do you have governing access to these?
#### Networks
* What networks do you have up? What devices are on them? How are they connected and separated?
* Do you have and maintain a network topology?
* Do you have and maintain a list of authorized devices for each network?
* Do you use firewalls? IDS(Intrusion Detection System)/IPS(Intrusion Prevention System) software? ACLs?
* What cloud services do you use?
* What do you do about patching and maintaining network devices?
#### Users
* Do employees have any security training or Social Engineering Awareness training?
* Do devices have specified owners and authorized users?
* Do you test employees for Social Engineering Awareness or security knowledge?
* Do you track your network logs?
* Do you have recovery plans for critical users? (The password owner gets hit by a bus)

#### How to do a self-assessment:

* Plan for Assessment - What are the deliverables of the assessment you want? What expectations do you have? What are your liabilities? What limitations do you want to put on the assessment?
* Create a Risk Profile - Enumerate your data, devices, and users. Next prioritize assets, identify likely targets, likely vulnerabilities, known threats, known threat actors, and known attack vectors.
* Perform Tests - Do social engineering tests to see if employees are educated. Try accessing physical locations that you shouldn’t be able to. Try accessing data that you shouldn’t be able to. Hire penetration testers if you want this and other things done professionally.
* Create a Security Program - Based on your findings from performing tests, identify ways which your business procedures could improve and integrate a security mindset. This is usually a set of policies which are specifically tailored to your business. Sample policies which are free to copy and widely used are provided by The SANS Institute. Any business can pick and choose what is applicable to them from these offerings.

Create Remediation and Business Continuity Plans - Plan for what to do in the event of an incident, and how to keep business running in the case of a number of contingencies.

### New Privacy and Security Regulations

For the first 30 years of the internet, you could hoard people’s personal data and there wasn’t much that anyone could do about it (except PCI and PHI). In light of recent high-profile data breaches and new regulations, this is rapidly changing.

#### GDPR

GDPR is a European Data Regulation scheme which went into effect May 25, 2018.

If you have personal data on European Citizens then GDPR applies to you.
In the GDPR “Personal Data” is any information that identifies a person or can be deduced to identify a person.

It regulates more than just breaches, including privacy issues such as the right to be forgotten.

EU regulators get expanded power to investigate - regulators make allegations, triggering a regulatory claim.

Defines roles - the data subject is the individual for whom the organization has information, a data controller is someone who collects and or uses personal data, a data processor is someone who handles data on behalf of controller, and the data protection officer is a person in charge of data protection (tasked with gdpr compliance) at a company.

Under GDPR, data subjects have a right to breach notification, right to access their data, the ‘right to be forgotten’ which means that a consumer has the right to ask a company to delete all their personally identifiable information and know that the company has complied.

Although it might not change much for most people, it’s important for everyone to understand because some violations can incur fines of up 20M Euros or 4% of global annual turnover - for example failure to report a data breach you are aware of to the data subject within 72 hours.

An even larger fine followed in Portugal, where the Comissao Nacional de Proteccao de Dados (NCPD) hit a hospital with a 400,000€ fine for allowing employees indiscriminate access to patient data. Barreiro Montijo lacked adequate staff to control access to patient information, the NCPD said, and, as a result, 985 persons associated with the profile “doctor” were granted access to the patient management system, despite the fact only 296 doctors actually worked at the hospital.

#### California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, known as CalCPA, will come into effect on January 1, 2020. It is similar to the GDPR in some ways, and different in others.

Any for-profit business in California which has 25M+ in Annual Gross Revenue or any company which receives or discloses PII of more than 50,000 California residents or devices must comply with CalCPA by 2020.

Similarly, Personally Identifiable Information is very broadly defined. Consumers have four specific rights with regard to their own PII.

* Right to know what a business has collected, where it was stored, what it is used for, whether and to whom it is being disclosed and sold
* Right to opt-out of selling information to third parties, or if you are under 16 the requirement that you (or your parents) must opt-in
* Right to have a business delete your PII if requested
* Right to receive equal service if you exercise your CalCPA PII rights

PII is defined as any information that can be linked to an individual. The text of the law has a non-exhaustive list of what this includes.





### Cyber Insurance Terminology


* Data Breach - Any incident where confidentiality of data is compromised, involving technology or not.
* Cyber Incident - An event involving technology which compromises confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data
* Regulatory Proceedings - Expenses which come from civil, administrative or regulatory proceedings by federal, state, local, or foreign governments.
* Website, Media, and Content Liability - Liability to others for defamation, title infringement, intellectual property rights infringement, misstatements, misrepresentations, and other issues arising from the use of electronic media

Things to Consider when shopping for Cybersecurity Insurance

#### For Data Breaches:
* Data Privacy Legal Services - Legal services to assist in determining liability and legal obligations following a cyber event.
* Forensics and IT Consulting - Expenses involved in hiring IT experts to determine scope, scale, and damages from a cyber event.
* Victim Notification and Remediation - Costs of notifying victims and providing remediation to comply with applicable laws and protect business reputation.
* Crisis Communication - Expenses to hire a public relations firm to help protect your brand and limit losses following a cyber incident

#### For Cyber Incidents:
* Data Restoration - Reimbursement for costs to restore and replace data and software damaged by cyber incidents.
* Mitigation Expenses - Costs to contain and eradicate an incident and restore the network to its condition before the loss.

#### For Regulatory Proceedings:
* Regulatory Investigation Expenses - Reimbursement for necessary expenses to comply with investigation for actual or alleged acts, errors, or omissions which result in violation of statutes or regulations regarding data security
* Regulatory/Contractual Fines, Penalties, and Assessments - Reimbursement of fines, penalties, and assessments for violation of any statute.

#### System Damage, Business Interruption, Extra Expense:
* Contingent Business Interruption - Reimbursement for income that would have been earned during interruption of third-party vendors and cloud service providers
* Contingent Reputational Damage - Reimbursement in profit directly related to reputational damage following cyber incidents
Extra Expenses - Reasonable and necessary expenses above normal operating expenses which incur during network impairment and restoration associated with resuming operations.
* Cybercrime - Including Electronic Theft, Business Identity Theft, Telephone Hacking, Cyber Extortion, Ransomware, Deceptive Funds Transfer Fraud (pretexting), Social Engineering (mostly phishing - which includes vishing, spearphishing, whaling, etc.)

The following are some terminology to consider when shopping for cyberinsurance:

* Sublimits - coverage maximums for specific expenses
* Coverages - definitions of what is covered by your insurance
* Exclusions - specific cases which are not included in coverages
* First Party Coverage - direct costs of responding to security failure of privacy breach, incl forensic investigation, legal advice, notification costs, credit monitoring, PR, loss of profits, extra expense - all of these are typically offered as sublimits of the liability
* Third Party Coverage - people sue you or regulators make claims, incl legal defense, settlements, damages, judgements, cost of reissuing credit cards, responding to regulatory inquiries, pci, and other regulatory fines and penalties
* There may be time limits to trigger business interruption - ie 8 hrs for network to be down
* Not Generally Covered: reputation harm, loss of future revenue, costs to improve internal technology systems, lost value of your own ip

### Conclusion

Most businesses can significantly improve their cyber defense posture by taking some simple steps and making an effort to think about cybersecurity as a part of everything they do.

Regulation is coming, and people who haven't had to worry until now will begin to see more consequences for not securing private data.

Cyberinsurance is one way to prepare yourself for the inevitability of being a victim of a cyber attack.

#### Technical stuff most people don’t need to know about GDPR

GDPR may not issue fines and penalties in certain jurisdictions, but this is ambiguous
It takes 28 implementations from 95 data protection directive and combines them into single regulation.
Member states can enforce the regulation with their DPA (data protection authority)
most violations - 10M Euros or 2% of global annual turnover
personal data includes hr, business contacts, behavioral information, it network traffic and logs, anything that can be associated back to a person
Info Lifecycle
Collect - fairly, receiving consent, relevance, proportionality, types of data
process - permission for specific data, purpose and to notify of changes
retain and secure - duration, types for retain, people processes tech and data loss for secure
manage - access, right to rectify, data destruction, transfer, applicable rules
7 essential qs
how do we manage and report on infosec management practices
what personal data is out there and where
can we monitor and control access to it
how can we ensure protection
how can we detect unauthorized access
how can we quickly and thoroughly notify in case of breach
prepare: full visibility, risk understanding
protect: technology, policies, practices
detect: siem, ips, etc


The GDPR suggests Data Inventory and Data Flow Mapping. They suggest doing a Risk Assessment first, then creating a Data Protection Plan, and finally setting up processes for Ongoing Assessment of risk.

PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is defined widely in the GDPR. It includes IP addresses associated with individuals, cookie data, addresses, names, social security numbers, RFID tags, health and genetic data, biometric data, racial data, ethnic data, political opinions, sexual orientation, and more. Companies are required to provide “reasonable” protections for this type of data, which is not yet well defined.
