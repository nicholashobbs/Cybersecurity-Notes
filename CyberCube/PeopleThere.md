### Self Intro

I am the Director of Cyber Risk Modeling for CyberCube. I lead modeling efforts related to cyber risk (data science, telemetry, threat intelligence, cyber attack modeling, cyber dependencies, etc.) powering our products. I’m part of the founding team that transitioned from Symantec, where I led various data science efforts for the development of a SaaS product helping cyber insurers stress test their exposure to various cyber attacks. I previously worked for leading global think tanks, financial institutions, and research organizations in the U.S. and in Europe. I hold a Ph.D. in Quantitative Economics from Université Paris-Dauphine and I am a Chartered Financial Analyst.

I love it at CyberCube – having the opportunity to crack big hairy cyber problems, work with our world-class team, and the ability to engage with our customers and partners makes it the best work environment I’ve worked in. In my spare time, I spend time with my family, mountain bike, skateboard, and root VMs.

### Previous Conversations

"Interesting Profile" with cyber and data stuff - same thing that Patrik is saying.
Cybercube now has 2 products in the market:
An underwriting product - set of scores for organizations which say what cyber risk they are exposed to
qualitative and quantitative views of risk
new initiatives for data collection
some academic, some data, some cyber people
enterprise risk management - portfolio of cyber policies and knowing what risks they are exposed to systemically
one example - huge dataset of port scan results: count open ports, command, dev environment, whole directories
he used satellite data to try to see power generation asses using as many channels as possible

Big road map of what they want to see on the project - working with three substreams, data, cyber, economic and qualtitative/actuarial,
Cyberdependencies
Recalibrating scores from their products
as a cyber risk analyst - this is a flat organization with a lot to learn.
They do weekly deep dives on something someone else at the organization is studying
i'll be speaking the same language as the people there

### Previous Conversations

What have I been doing and what role do I want

His self introduction - he has been there for 7 months performing security assesments, where he says he is automating his old job at kpmg and doing it at scale
He says there are 2 products -
one is account manager for specific companies which has a model for cyber maturity
the second product is for reinsurance companies catastrophe modeling - they want to diversify their risk in case of a hurricane in the cyber world
HE asked me about linux - vim, pipes, grep, what is a port, what is nat, segmenting subnets

told me to be conversant in the problems they are trying to solve - what are the current problems in the space, what are some ideas of how to improve those
he told me to prepare some SQL

## Patrik Maldre - Principal Intelligence Analyst

ask if he got recruited or applied there - very subtly flatter him. treat him like a teacher

## Andrew Goggins - Senior Economist

Liked when I asked him about how do you even begin to try to predict and model cyberrisks

## Ashwin Kashyap - Cofounder VP of Product and Analytics

Cofounder, head of product and analytics, believes in empowering creative, driven individuals who can win as a part of a team". Studied Statistical Signal Processing at Michigan. Wrote about measuring cyber aggregation risk.

## Pascal Millaire

## Sapna Blesson - Senior Software Engineer

I am one of the founding engineers at CyberCube. I continued my journey to CyberCube from Symantec. I am excited to be part of a fast growing startup solving cyber risk with world-class analytics. I drive the user interface of Cybercube and bridges the gap between product and engineering.

I have around 10 years of industry experience from silicon valley. Previously, I worked as front-end engineer at various companies ranging from startup to large organizations including Yahoo, Ericsson and early stage startup Choochee, which got acquired by Deutsche Telekom within 2 years for $100M. I graduated from San Jose State University, California with Master of Science in Computer Science.

I am from the beautiful tropical state in India, nick named as “God’s Own Country”, Kerala. In my free time, I am a creator. I love to do DIY projects, design with plants, try new recipes, photograph things that inspires me.

## Josh Pyle - Actuarial Director

I work as an Actuarial Director for CyberCube (after making the transition from Symantec), where I focus on analytics with respect to the construction of a suite of cyber insurance-focused products (spanning underwriting, attritional loss modeling, and catastrophe/aggregation risk). I have over 10 years of actuarial experience, working in the past for a few large insurance companies. My focus areas to date have been largely on predictive modeling, price optimization/demand modeling, and commercial and personal pricing. I am particularly fascinated by the impact of significant technology trends on our daily lives, and maintain a particular interest in the Internet of Things, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

Originally from southwest Missouri, I attended college in the lovely cornfields of Iowa at Grinnell College, studying mathematics and economics. I am a Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society. In my spare time, I enjoy too many hobbies to be especially good at any of them. These include, but are not limited to, backpacking/traveling, golf, tennis, billiards, skiing, no-limit hold ‘em poker, and woodworking.

## Julia Klepner - Product Manager

Julia joined CyberCube from Symantec as a Product Manager. Prior to joining the team, she worked in the Technology Division at Goldman Sachs and as a Cyber Intel Analyst at the US Dept. of Homeland Security. Julia hold a B.A. and M.A. in Psychology from Stanford University. In her spare time, she enjoys fencing, hiking, farmers markets and yoga.

## Kate Antonova - Data Engineer

I recently joined CyberCube team as a Data Engineer. As we work on the cyber insurance analytics, we need data to make right decisions. We partner with several vendors, Symantec is one of them, who provide us with different datasets about threats, leaks, breaches etc. that are happening around the globe almost real-time.

My role includes integration of different data sets into our datastore to allow easy SQL-based data access to our Analytics team.

I’m coming with 10 years of experience working in different data-related roles, from BI/Data Analyst to DevOps.Graduated from St. Petersburg State Polytechnical University with Master’s degree in Computer Science, I worked in several startups in Ad Tech space before (RadiumOne – acquired by Rhythmone, NebuAd).

Having been data analyst in the past, I know exactly what analytics team is expecting from me, how important is data quality and how crucial is attention to details in this position.

# Articles I Read from Website

## Measuring Cyber Aggregation Risk - Ashwin Kashyap

Insurers develop catastrophe models, for which cyberinsurance has the following challenges:
changing attackers and attacks, extended duration, definition of damage, reporting lag
CUBE Framework - technical dimensions are Attackers, Targets, Objectives, Vulnerabilities, Impact, Consequences
Kill Chain - Recon, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, Actions on Objectives

## Reinsurance - Pascal Millaire

200B IOT devices by 2020
global cost of cyber breaches was 275B to 6.6T
CyberCube has 1000+ single points of failure
understanding and modeling cyber risk well is the way for reinsurers to survive into the future

## Estimating the Global Cost of Cyber Risk

Split by countries, industry sectors, financial exposures: capital assets, ip, net income
perils: data breach, phishing, id theft, privacy violation, security incident
exfiltration of company data
exfiltration of customer data
degradation, corruption, destruction of data
loss of business due to distruption

systemic costs are higher than direct

## Actuaries Beware - Joshua Pyle

Insurance: corporate strategy, underwriting, pricing, aggregation management
must be priced at a low loss ratio due to high aggregation risk
Challenges: geography, external net vulnerabilities, human error, correlation of attacks, does attack make safer, what is cyber catastrophe, technological evolution, silent coverage

## Beyond Claims - Pascal Millaire, Joshua Pyle, + others

Internal Security Data - it assets, vulnerabilities, security incidents, internal asset coverage vs vulnerabilities, operating insights from inflection points (new systems, etc) - attack surface and exercised attack surface
external network data - Symantec deepsight, dmarc, spf, smtps
security protection data - underwriting questionairre
user behavior data
adversary intelligence

## Cyber Claims Study 2016

avg 2.04 median 1339 records exposed
avg 17035 cost per record, one was 1.6 million
avg breach cost 665k
blah blah stats....
